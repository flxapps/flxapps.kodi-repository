# MUBI Addon for Kodi

## What it is

Plugin to stream video from MUBI.com within Kodi / XBMC.

A [MUBI](https://www.mubi.com) account is required to use this plugin.

## Notes

You will need to have the [inputstream.adaptive](https://github.com/peak3d/inputstream.adaptive) plugin installed and enabled for this to work since Mubi now uses Dash (mpd). You can find this in the Ubuntu PPA.

Additionally, you will need to have Widevine libraries installed, which you can do from the inputstream.adaptive plugin.

## Installation

You can use the [FLX Apps Kodi repository](https://github.com/flxapps/flxapps.kodi-repository/) as a convenient way to install the plugin.
